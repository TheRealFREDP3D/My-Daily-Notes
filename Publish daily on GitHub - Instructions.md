# How to publish on GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub: Go to github.com and create a new repository. Give it a descriptive name, such as "my-career-change-journey", and choose "Public" or "Private" depending on your preferences.
2.Set up your local repository: Clone your newly created repository to your local machine using a Git client, such as GitKraken or Git Bash. Then, create a new folder on your local machine where you'll store your daily notes.
3.Write your daily notes: Write your daily notes in Obsidian as you normally would. Save your notes in the folder you created in step 2, using a naming convention that includes the date (e.g. "2023-04-03.md").
4.Commit and push your changes: Use your Git client to stage and commit your changes to your local repository. Then, push your changes to your GitHub repository using the "git push" command.
5.Repeat daily: Repeat steps 3 and 4 every day to add your new daily notes to your GitHub repo.

By following these steps, you'll have a public record of your daily notes on GitHub that you can share with others and look back on to track your progress. Good luck!
