That's a great idea to keep track of your progress towards your career goals! Daily notes can help you stay accountable, reflect on your accomplishments, and identify areas for improvement. Here are some tips for making the most out of your daily notes:

* Be consistent: Try to make a habit of writing your notes every day, at the same time and in the same place. This will help you build momentum and make it easier to stick to the habit.
  
* Use clear and concise language: Your notes should be easy to understand and quick to read. Use bullet points or short sentences to capture the key points of your day.
  
* Focus on actions and outcomes: Instead of just listing what you did, focus on the actions you took and the outcomes you achieved. For example, instead of writing "read an article about cybersecurity", write "spent 30 minutes reading an article about the latest cybersecurity threats and identified three key takeaways".
  
* Reflect on your progress: Take a few minutes at the end of each week to reflect on your progress towards your career goals. Ask yourself what you've learned, what challenges you've faced, and what you can do differently in the future.

* Stay organized: Use tags or categories in Obsidian to keep your notes organized and easy to search. You may also want to consider creating a separate note for each day, or grouping your notes by week or month.

 Good luck with your cybersecurity and IT training! Remember that every small step you take can make a big difference in the long run.

## How I can organize my daily notes in Obsidian to track my progress effectively ?

Great! It sounds like you're taking proactive steps towards achieving your career goals in the cybersecurity and IT field. Here are some suggestions on how you can organize your daily notes in Obsidian to track your progress effectively:

1. Create a master note for your career change plan: This note should include your long-term career goals, short-term objectives, and action steps that you need to take to achieve those goals. Use headers and bullet points to break down your plan into manageable tasks.

2. Use tags to categorize your daily notes: You can create tags for different areas of study, such as "ethical hacking", "cloud computing", and "programming". This will make it easier to search for notes related to a particular topic.

3. Create notes for specific projects: If you're working on a particular project, such as building a website or developing a mobile app, create a separate note for that project. Include details about the project, such as the tools and techniques you're using, and your progress.

4. Reflect on your progress regularly: At the end of each week or month, take some time to reflect on your progress. Review your notes and identify what worked well, what you need to improve on, and what new goals you want to set for the upcoming period.

5. Use Obsidian's linking feature to connect related notes: You can use the double square brackets "[[]]" to create links between related notes. For example, if you have a note about ethical hacking, you can create links to related notes about specific hacking techniques or tools.

Remember to keep your notes clear and concise, and focus on the actions you're taking towards your career goals. Good luck on your journey towards a new career in cybersecurity or IT!
