Here is the review of my first Daily Note from ChatGPT :

Overall, your daily note looks good! Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. Consider adding a brief summary at the top of your note that outlines the main activities you accomplished during the day. This will make it easier for you and others to quickly understand what you achieved.
2. It's great that you included the "Progress" section with the completion percentage for your SQL course, but you might also consider adding a brief summary of what you learned or accomplished during the course today.
3.Make sure to check that all the links and images are working correctly.
4.When you add tags to your note, try to make them as specific as possible. For example, instead of just using "SQL," you might consider using "SQL Manipulation" or "SQL Aggregate Functions."
5.Consider adding a section to your note that outlines your goals for tomorrow or what you plan to focus on next. This will help you stay organized and focused as you continue to work on your career goals.

Overall, your note is well-organized and includes detailed information about your activities and progress. Keep up the good work!
