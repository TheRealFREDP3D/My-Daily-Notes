## GitHub - Google - Need to learn about the "nagios NCPA" service running on HackTheBox machine Inject

- Looking for a way to exploit `HTB Inject machine`.  Didn't get lucky so far with this box.  I have rooted 4 boxes without to much problems this weekend.  This one is trickier I guess.  

- Finding this great article : [Escalating XSS to Sainthood with Nagios - GRIMM Blog](https://blog.grimm-co.com/2021/11/escalating-xss-to-sainthood-with-nagios.html)

- Follow a link to this awesome repository : `https://github.com/grimm-co/NotQuite0DayFriday`
