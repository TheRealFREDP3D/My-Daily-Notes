# Finishing my Obsidian Folder System

`Obsidian`

- I started experimenting with a Kanban board.  It's a nice way to display lists of tasks and their status. It's still a work in progress but I am happy with it.  It's more than a simple widget..

* My problem is that I had a long period of time when I didn't know what course I should take over another.  I didn't even know what I was suppose to learn.  So, I did explore a lot of learning resources.  I cumulated over 300 login credentials in my Password Manager (since last October). I had at least 15 courses titled "Python for Beginner" or "Introduction to Python".  Now that I actually completed some of them,  I realized that I need create a system to organize  my learning related notes and keep track of the current courses state of completion.

- I put some work earlier this week into finalize the folder three of my Obsidian Vault.  It's been a work in progress for weeks because I worked the wrong way.  "You don't know what you need until you need it.""  I learned this lesson the hard way: "Make plans before touching anything and then, move things around".

`The Root( "/" ) Folder `

- Every note (785) is now in one of the 8 Main Categories, and for most of them, inside a sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-folder. 

* I keep the media files (image, video, pdf) linked to a note inside a sub-folder `_attachment`  at the same location as the notefile.md. 
* Exemple: if there is a `image.png` in linked in the `/folder/notefile.md` , the image is put inside `/folder/_attachment`

> [!TIP]
> There is an Obsidian community plugin called ==Auto Note Mover==. 
> 
> It moves the media files attached to a note when things are moved around. It's
> done in real time without the need for any action from the user.  When a note
> is moved, the attached media is moved with it to a new `_attachment` sub-
> folder of the folder where the note land. Super Handy!

There a lot of place to add some more feature and maybe make this page a Personnal Dashboard.

Thanks for reading!  
Stay tuned, more good stuff coming...
