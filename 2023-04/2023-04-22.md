## Adding ChatGPT inside Obsidian

==**DONE!**== - I am able to interact with ChatGPT directly inside Obsidian.  It's nice to have this when needed.  Not hard to do at all by the way.  Get the plugin, put the ChatGPT API Key and ***Voila!***

## Trying to get the Obsidian Grammarly plugin to work

- So far, no luck...  There are working examples on GitHub and...I'll take a break for now. I'm missing something...

- ==**DONE!**== 1 hour later : There is a small icon that wasn't there before... "ENABLE GRAMMARLY".  I feel a little dumb right now.
